## Objective

The objective of this lab was to gain hands-on experience with the wxWidgets library by building a classic Minesweeper game. The assignment followed a guided tutorial and emphasized:

- Creating windows and interactive buttons.
- Managing events and game logic in a GUI context.
- Integrating C++ code with wxWidgets structures.

---

## Created With

- **Language**: C++
- **GUI Framework**: wxWidgets
- **IDE**: Visual Studio
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub

---

## Skills Acquired

- Fundamentals of GUI programming with wxWidgets.
- Event-driven architecture in C++ applications.
- Managing layouts, user input, and game state.
- Using Git and GitHub for source control and publishing.
